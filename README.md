This tool assists users in managing personal finances through natural language input and intelligent categorization, with seamless synchronization to Google Sheets for data storage. 

**Key Features:**

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Allows users to input transactions in everyday language, such as "Spent $50 on groceries yesterday." The application intelligently parses these inputs, automatically detects dates, and categorizes transactions appropriately.​

Chat-like Interface: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for entering financial data, enhancing the user experience.​

Google Sheets Integration: Ensures reliable and accessible data storage by syncing transaction data with Google Sheets.​

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, offering flexibility in usage across different platforms.​

Transaction Management: Supports various transaction types, including regular income and expenses, pending payments ("To Pay"), and pending receivables ("To Receive"). It also features hierarchical categorization with categories and subcategories, detailed descriptions, and flexible date handling for transaction and due dates.​

Analytics & Insights: Offers comprehensive financial analytics through an overview dashboard, income and expense analytics, and summaries of pending transactions. Advanced visualizations display monthly income versus expenses trends, category-wise breakdowns, top income sources, and weekly spending patterns. Smart insights analyze weekday versus weekend spending, fixed versus variable expenses, and week-of-month spending patterns. Flexible date filtering options include views for all time, yearly, monthly, and custom date ranges.​
